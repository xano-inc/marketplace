    <p>This extension supports three modes of authentication that can be leveraged for different requirements on your frontend application. Additional schema is merged into your user table to store necessary information in the google_oauth object.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Continue with Google</strong></span></p>
    <p>This mode is the most flexible because it allows both sign up and login in the same API request. If you want an extremely low friction entry point and don&#39;t have special sign up requirements, this is the best way to create a seamless experience for your customer.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Login with Google</strong></span></p>
    <p>This mode allows you to login to your application with your Google account. If you did not sign up previously through your Google account, then this API will fail. &nbsp;This API request is normally used in conjunction with the Sign up request.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Sign up with Google</strong></span></p>
    <p>This mode allows you to sign up to your application with your Google account. &nbsp;This request will only work once for your user as it throws an error if you have a customer that has already signed up previously with this same request. If you have special requirements like perhaps an invite code, then this request tends to be more flexible than the &quot;continue with google&quot; version.</p>
